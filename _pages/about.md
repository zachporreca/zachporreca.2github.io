Hello, thanks for taking a look! I'm getting ready to start a Post-doc position in the [CLEAN unit](https://clean.unibocconi.eu/) at Bocconi University, where I will continue studying the economics of law and crime. I completed my PhD in Economics at West Virginia University in February of 2023. Primarily, my research is focused on (what I find to be) interesting empirical solutions to analyzing those inherently hard to measure components of human behavior. This is what fascinates me about crime as a field: much of the behavior of criminal actors does deliberately avoids leaving a data/paper trail. There are so many fun and unique challenges to analyzing human behavior outside of traditional institutions. Before joing WVU's Economics department, I spent a year in the Natural Resource Economics department here, working on research related to fishery production. My undergrad was completed through Pell Grant funding at Bloomsburg University in Central Pennsylvania. In my free time I like to travel and spend time outdoors.
